AI-First Lab: Algorithms & Data Structures behind AI 🧠
Stop treating AI like a "Black Box". Start understanding the foundation.
Welcome to the AI-First Lab. This repository contains Python implementations of fundamental algorithms and data structures that power modern Artificial Intelligence.

Most students learn AI by just importing libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. But do you truly understand why they work?

This codebase connects the dots between Classical CS (Graphs, Trees, Lists) and Modern AI (Neural Networks, Decision Trees, Recommendation Engines).

📂 What's in this Repo?
Neural Networks as Graphs: A clean implementation showing how backpropagation is just a pathfinding problem on a computational graph.

Recommendation Engines: How simple Lists and Hash Maps create the foundation for collaborative filtering.

Gradient Descent: Visualizing optimization algorithms from scratch, without the "magic" of heavy libraries.



📘 The "AI-First" Workshop (Full Guide)
The code in this repository is part of the "AI-First: Algorithms and Data Structures as the Foundation of AI" curriculum.

If you feel lost looking at the code, or if you want to understand the logic and pedagogy behind every line, I have written a comprehensive, hands-on workshop for students and beginners.

It bridges the gap between being a "coder" and an "engineer".
